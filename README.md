# LandBarons

This game was designed by Dr. Nathan Gossett at Bethel University for the final project of his Spring 2019 Data Structures and Algorithms Course.

This project has been made public with his permission with the understanding that the material used within may be examined by potential employers.

The premise of the game is that a company wants to connect two different cities by buying the land between them. The players have become aware of the cities intent ahead of time and want to buy up the land between the cities so that they can charge the company a much higher price than what they bought the tiles for.

The players spend the game bidding on these tiles and the game end when both players pass in a row. The company then determines what the cheapest path between the two towns is, buying up the land in between. The victor of the game is then the player who made the most amount of money at the end, after their payments have been received from the company.

Software Engineering
The game employs a Model View Controller (MVC) paradigm to maintain data security. Furthermore, we adherred to the principles of object oriented design as a matter of best practice.

Algorithm Design
The game also uses Djikstra's algorithm to determine the cheapest path at the end, this is just one example of the algorithms that we learned over the course of the semester.
